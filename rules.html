            Doktor Jamesâ€™ Kastle of Katastrophe is designed as an adventure with
            combat, exploration and roleplaying to stop a powerful supervillain
            but it can be played as a single encounter skirmish, a multi
            encounter delve, or even as a full campaign with persistent heroes,
            a plot and a wider world to explore.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you have a group of people prepared to play with you, one of
            you should be designated the Game Master (or GM). Its their job to
            paint a picture of what is going on around you. Whilst you will play
            specific characters, the GM will be playing everything else you
            encounter. It is therefore encouraged that you be extra nice to them
          </p>
          <p>
            The GM will present the situation in front of you and then it is
            your job as players to tell them and the group what you want your
            character to do. To keep it fair, whenever there is a chance you
            could fail at something you will need to roll some dice to see if
            you succeed. For example if you try to blast a robot with a
            fireball, its possible you could miss so you would need to roll some
            dice to see if you do or not. This is true, not just for the players
            but also your enemies, if they are trying to hurt you. This is
            covered in more detail below.
          </p>
          <p>
            The rules below are very simple but if you are running the game and
            your players think of something fun or interesting or out of the box
            then you should be able to bend the rules to make it possible,
            unless of course it makes absolutely no sense. The rules are
            designed to add structure for the fun, not to stop the fun
            altogether.
          </p>
          <p>
            The prewritten adventure is currently not included on this site but
            you can use these rules to play your own adventures that you have
            written to battle Doktor James.

          <h2 class="rules-section-heading">Rolling for stuff</h2>
          <p>
            The most important part of any roleplaying game is of course rolling
            for stuff. For this game you will only need a six sided dice. If you
            have even more then thats great!
          </p>
          <p>
            The amount of dice you roll will depend on your attributes which are
            at the left of your character sheets. The thing you will need to
            roll most of all will be whether or not you hit something when you
            attack them or to see if you get hit yourself. As such there are
            four dice "pools" which dictate how good you are at something.
          </p>
          <p>
            These four dice pools are called Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence
            and Resistance. Heroes (and enemies) can only roll one of these if
            you have at least one dice in the pool as shown in the examples
            here.
          </p>
          <p>
            It should be noted that certain special abilities can add dice to
            your pool under certain conditions. For example the "Just Good At
            Fighting" character has a special attack called "Strikeback Action"
            which adds an additional dice to the strength pool if you attack
            someone who has hit you since your last turn.

          <p>
            Assuming you can't talk your way out of a fight then you will most
            likely be getting into lots of scrapes and as such should know how
            to do that.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a hero or enemy is attacking they will need to roll a number of
            six sided dice equal to the amount in the appropriate dice pool. For
            example if you are trying to punch someone and you have two dice in
            your strength dice pool then you will need to roll two six sided
            dice.
          </p>
          <p>
            The defender of the attack will then need to roll the number of dice
            in their resistance dice pool and compare dice.
          </p>
          <p>
            The attacker and defender need to see what the highest number they
            have rolled is. If the attacker has matched or exceeded the highest
            number rolled by the defender then their attack is successful. If
            the attacker's highest dice is lower than the defender's highest
            dice then the attack misses
          </p>
          <p>
            Check out these examples and see if you can work out whether the
            attacks hit or miss.

                This is your bog standard attack. It will use the dice pool from

                This is a special kind of attack (you may have guessed by the

                certain conditions. These normally will override the usual rules
                to let you do something a bit better such as an area of effect
                attack, a long range attack or the like.

                Bonus abilities are usually passive abilities (which means they
                dont affect attacking) which allow you do something cool such as
                being able to ricochet arrows around corners or being able to
                jump over obstacles with ease or the like. Be aware of these as
                they will almost certainly add extra super heroey elements to
                battles.

          <h4>How to roll for skills</h4>
          <p>
            Outside of hitting things your characters might also have other
            skills which will come in useful. Acrobatic skills or technological
            skills or perhaps just knowing things about stuff. To work out if
            you are successful at these things you will need to do a skill
            check.
          </p>
          <p>
            Firstly the GM will need to decide on a difficulty for the thing you
            want to do. For example, 3 if its really simple to achieve or 6 if
            its something super hard.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then you roll your dice. You get one dice to start off with. If you
            have the appropriate skill symbol (see below) on the bottom right of
            your character sheet then you can add an extra dice. On top of that,
            if you have any natural ability then you can add on the appropriate
            dice pool. For example if you are trying to do a backflip you would
            get one dice to begin with, plus one dice if you have the acrobatics
            skill, plus the amount of dice you have in your dexterity pool.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the highest number on your dice is equal to or greater than the
            difficulty that the GM has set then you succeed at what you were
            trying to do!
          </p>

              The most important of all the stats, Health will tell you how many
              hits you can take before you get knocked out. There are no deaths
              in this game, just temporary unconciousness. Its a superhero game.
              If you were killed you'd be brought back later on anyway.

            <p>
              All of the heroes have three spaces for there health. When you
              take a hit you put a cross in one of the squares. If all of the
              squares have a cross in them then you have been knocked out I am
              afraid!

            <p>
              Depending on how tough an enemy is they will have a different

            <h2>Damage</h2>
            <p>
              If an attack lands its very simple. Generally you just do one
              square of damage. Some attacks can do more than one square of
              damage but that will very much depend on those special attacks.
            </p>
            <p>
              To make things more fun, if a player manages to do damage to an
              enemy, why not reward them with a sweet or other treat.

            <h2>Healing</h2>
            <p>
              Being able to take only three hits will mean that finding ways to
              heal yourself is super important. Luckily there are lots of ways
              to heal yourself and even luckier, they are all displayed here for
              you with nice symbols and things.

          <h1 class="text-center">Battles!</h1>
          <p>
            Battles and how they are structured are probably the most
            complicated part of the game and the part you will most likely spend
            most time doing so we've broken it down into eight simple steps.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h3>1. Preperation</h3>
          <p>
            The GM tells you that you are about to do a fight. They set up a map
            for you and place your tokens to show you where you are in relation
            to all the enemies.
          </p>
          <h3>2. Initiative</h3>
          <p>
            One member of your team rolls a six sided die. The GM also rolls one
            for the enemies. Whoever's is highest gets to go first.
          </p>
          <h3>3. Rounds</h3>
          <p>
            A round is the length of time for all of the team to have their turn
            to do something and for all of the enemies to have their turn to
            fight back.
          </p>
          <h3>4. Turns</h3>
          <p>
            Each player and each enemy has one turn during the round. You as
            players can decide which order you go in. Each turn you have an
            action you can do and movement.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h3>5. Actions</h3>
          <p>
            Actions can be any of the following, attacking an enemy, healing an
            ally with magic, taking your movement again (if you don't make it to
            where you want to be with your normal movement), using a skill or
            using an item you have found (such as medicine).
          </p>
          <h3>6. Movement</h3>
          <p>
            You can move up to six squares in any direction including
            diagonally. If you can fly you can also move upwards! You can use
            your action to do this again if you like.
          </p>
          <h3>7. Resolution</h3>
          <p>
            The combat ends when either all your enemies are defeated, you and
            your allies have been knocked unconcious (uh oh!) or if you have
            managed to run away or end the combat peacefully.
          </p>
          <h3>8. Rewards</h3>
          <p>
            You get to search the bodies, do some looting and possibly are given
            bonus treats depending on your performance and how much of a
            pushover the GM is.
